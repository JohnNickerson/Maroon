ICommand
	Guid CommandID
	Guid ObjectID
	DateTime TimeStamp

Use SharpSerializer to store individual ICommand objects. Allow them to be synchronised by external file sync processes.
Run a single-instance service to pick up command files and include them in a central command log.
	- This is the one part that feels off to me, but creating a single file should make some actions easier.
	- I could, theoretically, just process a directory of single command files as an API action.
Run many services to keep re-processing that command log to produce query data stores.
Need separate command IDs and object IDs to individually identify each command as well as the object record it relates to (if any).
